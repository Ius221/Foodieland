                            answer: "No legal definition exists beyond meat/poultry (minimally processed, no artificial ingredients). Often misleading marketing with no verification required."

                            answer: "No. Non-GMO products may still use synthetic pesticides. Organic always includes non-GMO, but non-GMO doesn't ensure organic farming practices."

                            answer: "Without third-party certification (e.g., Rainforest Alliance), it's unregulated. Look for specific practices mentioned rather than vague sustainability claims."
